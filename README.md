# WikaKita

A flashcard app for learning Tagalog vocabulary. A user goes through the vocab list and clicks 'yes' or 'no' if they remember the word or not. If the user clicked on 'yes', the word is moved down in priority while a 'no' is moved up in priority. This allows users to focus on words that need improvement. When the user has completed the list, they can view their score at the end.

The frontend is made with React/Redux and MongoDB for the database.
